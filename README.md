# Cod Projects and Scripts

- **[GetssBot](/getssbot)**: simple telegram bot written in python that monitors a specific folder and send all news jpg file to specific telegram users/groups. So configuring to monitor the screenshot cod server folder it sends us all new players ss made. The bot accepts two arguments, the full path folder and how many seconds the folder is monitored.
- **[Cod4ManagerBot](/cod4-manager-bot)**: telegram bot written in C# that let you send rcon commands to a cod4 server and 'offban' (ban a player that is not playing) recent players. To authorize new users they must send a message to the bot with text 'sendid' and you will receive a pm from bot that ask if add them or not. Set your tg id in the config file. Example config file: */cod4-manager-bot/Data/config/config.json.EXAMPLE*.
- **[Cod4Dashboard](/cod4dashboard)**:
  - *backend*: apollo graphql express server that exposes the cod4 players statistics from a sqlite db (db used from the GSManager system). The server can query the cod server status and send rcon commands. It's possible to set specific players to be shown as admin or vip. Set their player id on file */cod4dashboard/backend/src/admins-vips.js* (TODO: write this info in a config file instead a js file).
  - *frontend*: web app built with sapper/svelte that displays players statistics, cod server status and the possibility to send rcon commands to the cod server (like a remote terminal for it).
  - *sqlitedb*: folder that must contains the sqlite database with the players statistics (GSManager db).
- **[Cod4LogManager](/cod4-log-manager)**: log monitor for a cod4 server. The desired result for this project is to build a system like GSManager but written in nodejs and not php. Only a few commands have been implemented but the monitoring system is stable (without the bug that the system must force a fast map restart to handle the log correctly) and it is possible to expand the functionalities at will. Check the example config in the */cod4-log-manager/src/config* folder (you must remove the .EXAMPLE extension).
